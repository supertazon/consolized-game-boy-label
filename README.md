# consolized-game-boy-label
A label to use on Joe Ostrander's consolized Game Boy project: https://github.com/joeostrander/consolized-game-boy
The PDF can be sent to a print shop, it is set at the correct size to use on the NESPi door. The SVG file was built using Inkscape and vectorized logos I found the respective Wikipedia pages of the Game Boy and the NES.
