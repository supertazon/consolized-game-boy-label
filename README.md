# consolized-game-boy-label
A label to use on Joe Ostrander's consolized Game Boy project: https://github.com/joeostrander/consolized-game-boy.

For personal and educational use only.
The PDF can be printed directly, it is set at the correct size to use on the NESPi's case door. The SVG file was built using Inkscape and vectorized logos I found on the respective Wikipedia pages of the Game Boy and the NES. The SVG is easier to edit in case you want to make your own modifications.
